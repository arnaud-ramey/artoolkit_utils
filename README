ARToolKit ( http://www.hitl.washington.edu/artoolkit/ ) is a computer tracking
library for creation of augmented reality applications that overlay virtual
imagery on the real world.

It works with so-called pattern files, representing the visual appearance of
the markers. These patterns are then searched in the input stream of image.

Two programs are given here:
* One can transform color or BW images into ARToolkit patterns.
* One can transform ARToolKit patterns into images for visualizing them

It requires OpenCV and curl.
